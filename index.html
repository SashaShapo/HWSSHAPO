		<h1>I was born in Kharkov in 1998 and live here for 21 years.<br>
I first went to school №93 <br>	
After 3 classes I moved to another school №33 and studied there for a year. <br> I didn’t like this school at all and I asked my parents to change it for another. <br> Thus, I ended up in school №3 and studied there until the 9th grade. <br>
I had many friends and even more acquaintances.<br>
I can't say, that I loved to learn and made great efforts to this.<br>But, I had several favorite teachers and I tried to teach them out of respect.<br>
After passing the tests, I went to study at the HRTT after the technical school,<br> I applied to the KPI and now I study there on the 3rd course.

Since childhood I have always been an energetic child. <br>
I loved to ski with his grandfather in the park. From 5 years old I rode a bicycle.<br> Dropped on the mountain, highway, single-speed, fix. I ride the highway now and enjoy it. <br>
Also keen on boxing kickboxing swimming badminton. <br>
Since I don’t like the public, I didn’t like much to perform at competitions.

GOALS and DREAMS <br>
Since I love to ride a bike, my goal is to buy a motorcycle. <br>
I have no easy way to earn money and I was born in a poor family. <br> In order to fulfill my desires, I want to learn everything that can be given to me here. <br>I believe that even without knowledge in half a year I will be able to become a person who understands this profession.
